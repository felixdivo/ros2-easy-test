class ROS2TestEnvironment(Node):
    """This class provides a way to interact with nodes and assert that events happen or do not.

    **Publishing** messages works by creating a publishers on the fly.
    However, one must ensure that the type of the message that is published stays the same across each test.

    For **subscribers**, the topics and their types must be declared at the instantiation via the
    ``watch_topics`` argument. This cannot be avoided due to how *rclpy* works.
    Then, a mailbox is created for each topic and incoming messages are collected each (without a limit).
    This is performed in the background, meaning that for example :meth:`~assert_message_published` may return
    a message that was collected before the method was called.
    To prevent this from happening, one might use :meth:`~clear_messages`
    (although the concurrency is often the desired behaviour).
    Also, mind the ``timeout`` / ``time_span`` arguments as they determine how long to wait while checking the
    assertion (default: ``1`` second).
    Asserting that a message is sent or failing to assert that no message is sent will return early.

    **Services** are handled similarly to publishers, being created on the fly when used for the first time.

    Note:
        The :class:`ROS2TestEnvironment` is a :class:`rclpy.node.Node` too, which allows to implement custom
        functionality too.

    Note:
        Timings and timeouts in this class are only approximate.
